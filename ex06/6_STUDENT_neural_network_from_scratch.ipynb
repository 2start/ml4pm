In this implementation it is the sum of lengths of the flatten entries in the params_values dictionary returned by the init_layers function. This results to 5226 parameters. So this is ca. five times our input data which might enough to give each datapoint a representation in the parameters. It would be problematic if the number of parameters is smaller than the number of datapoints. So this number should be appropriate."
